# britter's dotfiles

This is a repository containing configuration files for my development environment.

## Inspiration

My dotfiles are heavily inspired by [Ben Ripkens'](http://github.com/bripkens/dotfiles) dotfiles.
He drew his inspiration from [Mathias Bynens'](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) and
[Ben Alman's](https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles) and many other great blog posts on the web.

Thanks guys!
